## VLAO Calculation for Function $H$

These files are input examples for the VLAO calculation used to compute the function $H$.

- The result for triphenylphosphine (**L12**) can be reproduced by running the VLAO calculation with these input files and `z_function.py`.
- To reproduce results for other ligands, modify `X_real.csv` to include the corresponding $\mathbf{x}$ vector, then run the VLAO calculation.
